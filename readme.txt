Loads the RSS feed from WoW Hunter's Hall on your site with as little configuration as possible.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin to create a new widget which will automatically grab the RSS feed from the 
WoW Hunter's Hall web site and display between 1 and 10 posts from that site in a widget-ready sidebar on 
yours.  Could you do this with the normal WordPress RSS widget?  Sure!  But you'd need to know the location
of the feed.  With this plugin, you don't.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload `whh-feed.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/whh-feed/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the Appearance menu and select Widgets.  If you don't see Widgets, then your theme doesn't support them.
1. Find `WoW Hunter's Hall Feed` within the list of other widgets and drag it to the sidebar where you want it to be.
1. Edit the default title for the widget (if desired) and then select how many posts you want to show.
